## Creating an infographic assignment
In working on this assignment, I was curious about which musical artists were most popular this past year. Since most music is currently listened to through streaming services, and Spotify is the most widely used streaming service, I chose to focus specifically on that data. I used data from Spotify itself from its 2023 and 2022 “Spotify Wrapped,” where the company reviews the individual statistics of each Spotify user as well as the overall data relating to the popularity of songs and artists. That data can be found [here](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-11-30/the-top-songs-artists-podcasts-and-listening-trends-of-2022/) and [here](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-11-29/top-songs-artists-podcasts-albums-trends-2023/). I was able to find the top 10 global artists of 2023 and noticed that they were different but had much overlap with the top global artists of 2022. I assume when this year’s Spotify Wrapped comes out, many of these same artists will remain on the top 10 list.
