## Creating an infographic assignment
In working on this assignment, I was curious about which musical artists were most popular this past year. Since most music is currently listened to through streaming services, and Spotify is the most widely used streaming service, I chose to focus specifically on that data. I used data from Spotify itself from its 2023 and 2022 “Spotify Wrapped,” where the company reviews the individual statistics of each Spotify user as well as the overall data relating to the popularity of songs and artists. That data can be found [here](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-11-30/the-top-songs-artists-podcasts-and-listening-trends-of-2022/) and [here](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-11-29/top-songs-artists-podcasts-albums-trends-2023/). I was able to find the top 10 global artists of 2023 and noticed that they were different but had much overlap with the top global artists of 2022. I assume when this year’s Spotify Wrapped comes out, many of these same artists will remain on the top 10 list.

## A Timeline of Kaytranada's Rise to Musical Success
This timeline illustrates some of the major moments in the career of now very successful musical artist Kaytranada. In this timeline, I outlined moments that shaped his rise to success, defined his distinct sound, and solidified him as one of the most influential and popular musical artists of a generation. As a huge fan of Kaytranada myself (and someone who just saw him in concert last week) I was drawn to map out a visualization of his inspirational rise to success. The data for this story was gathered from [thecanadianencyclopedia.ca](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/kaytranada) and [rollingstone.com](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kaytranada-new-album-timeless-interview-1235019415/).

## Lehigh University Ethnicity Bar Chart
This bar chart represents the break down, by ethnicity, of undergraduate students at Lehigh University. This graph shows what percentage of the undergraduate student population identifies with each ethnicity. Looking at this chart, it is clear that there are significant imbalances on Lehigh's campus. White students make up the vast majority of the undergraduate population where as other groups such as American Indian/ Alaska Natives or Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islanders are not part of the campus body at all. This graph is also interesting in comparison to the general population of the US. Looking at U.S. Census data, American is made of higher percentages of Black/ African American people and Hispanic people than the populations seen at Lehigh. The data I used to create this graph came from [Lehigh University Statistics](https://www2.lehigh.edu/about/university-statistics).

## Lehigh University Accaptance Rate Over the Years Bar Chart
This line graph displays the acceptance rate at Lehigh University for each graduating class. Like many other schools, Lehigh had significant changes in it's acceptance rate during the pandemic and as a result, many different graduating classes have had different experiences with admission selectivity.
